# Pixel Pomo
This is my take on the « *simple timer/to do list app* ». A silent Pomodoro for those who don’t like to be interrupted during their focus mode. There is a checkbox to delay the break. A to do list limited to 5 tasks to not overwhelm oneself. Cozy, mindful and (obviously) productive.

### What is a Pomodoro? 
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management strategy designed to reduce procrastination. It involves working in the format of 25 minutes of a focused session, followed by 5 minutes of break. This cycle repeats until the tasks are done.

### The ideal user
This app was developed keeping in mind my experience with pomodoro games/mobile apps and the testimonies heard in productivity communities over the years. 

Personna: Young self employed professional, takes time to go into focus mode, easily overwhelm by tasks and distracted by design, is motivated by seeing progress.

That's why I created a minimalistic design but with a heart. The theme is coffee, giving a cozy vibe reinforced by the pixel design to differenciate the pomodoro in the market. Pixel coffee beans are loading, reminding the user of the incoming coffee break.  

## The code
### Little context on my work
I started this project after 2 months of React theory so I was really rusty in JS and CSS. I wanted to use this opportunity to familiarise myself with the languages again and gave myself a loose deadline. It really wasn’t a nice sensation to be in front of a blank page and realize I forgot how to code. I learned A LOT. I played around and tried different logics, reading the documentation I didn’t have the energy when learning the theory. All in all it was a fun project and I was able to create something ambitious and close to my vision.
